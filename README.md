# Norella - beauty studio
Mobile-first, fully responsive CMS system build to increase number of customers. They have been using facebook for online marketing so I thought it might be a good idea to create portfolio site but with dynamic content. After they are logged in, they can add/edit/delete (CRUD) products and photos. Image/Intervention scales uploaded image to three diffrent sizes to be able to optimize page loading. Server detects which image size to provide. https://norella.pl
